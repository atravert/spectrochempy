    "\n",
    "The above directives require explicitly writing the absolute pathnames, which are\n",

    "If, for instance, Brian has a project organised in a folder (`s` ) with a directory\n",
    "dedicated to input data (`Life` )\n",
    "and a notebook for preprocessing (`welease.ipynb` ) as illustrate below:\n",
    "\n",

    "|    |    |   +-- welease.ipynb\n",

    "```\n",

    "Then running this project in John's Linux computer (e.g. in `/home/john/s_copy` )\n",

    "OSError: Can't find this filename C:\\users\\Brian\\s\\life\\wodger.spg\n",

    "In this respect, a good practice consists in using relative pathnames in scripts and\n",
    "notebooks.\n",
    "Fortunately, SpectroChemPy readers use relative paths. If the given path is not\n",
    "absolute, then SpectroChemPy will search in the current directory. Hence, the opening\n",
    "of the `spg` file from scripts in `welease.ipynb` can be made\n",
    "by the command:\n",
    "```ipython3\n",
